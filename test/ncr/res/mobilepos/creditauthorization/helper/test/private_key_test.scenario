Scenario: Testing retrieving private key from keystore file
!-- pass keystore file and password to the constructor
Given a PrivateKey object with keystorefile{test/ncr/res/mobilepos/creditauthorization/helper/test/AES_MasterKey.keystore} and password{changeit}
!-- get the value of key identified by the alias
Then should get key{ExampleRES30} with alias{AESKey}

Scenario: Testing saving a private key from keystore file
!-- pass keystore file and password to the constructor
Given a PrivateKey object with keystorefile{test/ncr/res/mobilepos/creditauthorization/helper/test/AES_MasterKey.keystore} and password{changeit}
!-- set the value of key identified by the alias
Then should be able to set alias{AESKeyGenDate} with key{20121221121212}
!-- get the value of key identified by the alias
Then should get key{20121221121212} with alias{AESKeyGenDate}

Scenario: Testing deleting a private key from keystore file
!-- pass keystore file and password to the constructor
Given a PrivateKey object with keystorefile{test/ncr/res/mobilepos/creditauthorization/helper/test/AES_MasterKey.keystore} and password{changeit}
!-- delete the key identified by the alias
Then should be able to delete alias{AESKeyGenDate}
!-- the value of key identified by the alias should be empty
Then should get key{empty} with alias{AESKeyGenDate}
