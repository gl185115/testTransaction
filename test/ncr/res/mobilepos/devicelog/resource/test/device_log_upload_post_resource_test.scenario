Story: Upload log files from mobile devices with POST
I want to upload log files from mobile device with POST.
I should be able to send an upload request with the store ID and terminal ID of the device for a given date

Scenario: Normal device-log file upload with POST
Given a store id '<storeid>'
And a terminal id '<termid>'
And a content of log '<data>'
And a time to trigger the method '<time>'
And a name of the file stored in local '<filename>'
When I request for upload
Then the result should be '<uploadResult>'

Examples:
|storeid|termid|data|time|filename|uploadResult
||1111|aaabbbccc|20151225160530|MobileShop_000001_1111_20151225160530.log|failed
|000001||aaabbbccc|20151225160530|MobileShop_000001_1111_20151225160530.log|failed
|000001|1111||20151225160530|MobileShop_000001_1111_20151225160530.log|failed
