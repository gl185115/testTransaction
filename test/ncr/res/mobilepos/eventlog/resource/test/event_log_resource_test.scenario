Scenario: standard EventLog test set (normal, dup, normal, read)
Given a EventLog Resource
Given a RESTransaction DBInitiator
Given TXL_OPE_EVENT is empty

When executing log with company{01} storeid{0003} workstationid{0005} sequenceNumber{10} businessDayDate{2015-08-15} training{0} and log{{"test": "yes"}}
Then result should be {0}
Then TXL_OPE_EVENT should have the following row(s):
|CompanyId|RetailStoreId|WorkstationId|SequenceNumber|ChildNumber|BusinessDayDate|TrainingFlag|Log|
|01       |0003         |0005         |10            |0          |2015-08-15     |0           |{"test": "yes"}|

When executing log with company{01} storeid{0003} workstationid{0005} sequenceNumber{10} businessDayDate{2015-08-15} training{0} and log{{"test": "no"}}
Then result should be {0}
Then TXL_OPE_EVENT should have the following row(s):
|CompanyId|RetailStoreId|WorkstationId|SequenceNumber|ChildNumber|BusinessDayDate|TrainingFlag|Log|
|01       |0003         |0005         |10            |0          |2015-08-15     |0           |{"test": "yes"}|

When executing log with company{01} storeid{0003} workstationid{0005} sequenceNumber{11} businessDayDate{2015-08-15} training{0} and log{{"test": "no"}}
Then result should be {0}
Then TXL_OPE_EVENT should have the following row(s):
|CompanyId|RetailStoreId|WorkstationId|SequenceNumber|ChildNumber|BusinessDayDate|TrainingFlag|Log|

When read log with company{01} storeid{0003} workstationid{0005} sequenceNumber{10} training{0}
Then result json should be {{"test": "yes"}}
