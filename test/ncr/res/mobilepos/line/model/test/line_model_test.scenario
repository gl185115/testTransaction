Given an empty Line
Then I should have a Line that has errors

Given a Line with Item line {Line-001}, retailStoreId {Store-0031}, lineName {Men's Line}, lineNameLocal {Men's Line Local}, dpt {DPT-001}
Then it has no error
Then its Item Line is {Line-001}
Then its RetailStoreId is {Store-0031}
Then its Line Name is {Men's Line}
Then its Line Name Local is {Men's Line Local}
Then its DPT is {DPT-001}

Then I should have searched lines {RetailStoreID: Store-0031; Line: Line-001; Description: en: Men's Line; jp: Men's Line Local; ; Department: DPT-001; TaxType: null; TaxRate: null; DiscountType: null; ExceptionFlag: null; DiscountFlag: null; DiscountAmount: 0.0; DiscountRate: 0.0; AgeRestrictedFlag: null; InheritFlag: null; SubSmallInt5: null; }
