Scenario: Get the last transaction on a known Store and known Terminal

!-- Start the Joiurnal resource
Given a Journalization Resource
Given a RESTransaction DBInitiator
!-- Empty first the TXL_POSLOG to be safe
Given TXL_SALES_JOURNAL is empty

!-- Start test here
Given a batch of values for POSLOGs named TXL_POSLOG_COMPLETE.xml
When a request for last transaction to a storeid{000031} and terminalid{9999}
Then result should be {OK}
Then the POSLOG should should have BeginDateTime{2012-03-06T15:29:42}
Then the POSLOG should should have Transaction ID{4481}

!-- Get last Transaction from another known Terminal
When a request for last transaction to a storeid{000031} and terminalid{999}
Then result should be {OK}
Then the POSLOG should should have BeginDateTime{2012-02-29T18:19:58}
Then the POSLOG should should have Transaction ID{4180}

When a request for last transaction to a storeid{000031} and terminalid{1111}

Then the POSLOG should should have Transaction ID{8009}

!-- Get last Transaction from another unknown Terminal
When a request for last transaction to a storeid{000031} and terminalid{1111111}
Then result should be {TX_NOT_FOUND}
Then the POSLOG should be empty

!-- Get last Transaction from another unknown StoreID
