Scenario: Perform SQLStatementTest Usual
Given an SQL Statement Listing from {test/ncr/res/mobilepos/property/test/sql_statements.xml}
When I get an Item from Listing with key {select-table1}
Then I should get the value {SELECT * FROM TABLE1}
When I get an Item from Listing with key {delete-table1}
Then I should get the value {DELETE FROM TABLE1 WHERE COL_ID = 1}
When I get an Item from Listing with key {update-table1}
Then I should get the value {UPDATE TABLE1 SET COL1 = 1 WHERE COL_ID = 1}
